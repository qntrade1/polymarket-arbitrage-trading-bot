## 🎯 Arbitrage Strategies

I implemented these **7 Polymarket arbitrage trading strategies**  for premium version:

1. **Strategy 1**: Liquidity Absorption Flip  
Overview: Build a large low-cost position by soaking bot liquidity, then briefly force the reference market price at resolution to flip the outcome and cash the higher Polymarket payout.


2. **Strategy 2**: Orderbook Parity Arbitrage (Pre-Fee Era)  - <span style="background-color: #4CAF50; color: white; padding: 2px 8px; border-radius: 4px; font-weight: bold;">Current repo's plan</span>  
Overview: Exploited brief moments where YES + NO priced below $1 on short windows, buying both sides simultaneously and holding to settlement to harvest tiny, repeatable mispricings—an edge erased by the 3.15% fee.  
Contrast — Post-Fee Adaptation: Liquidation Momentum Filter  
Overview: After fees killed parity arbitrage, the surviving bot shifted to entering only during forced-liquidation spikes, trading explosive moves where payout asymmetry outweighed fees, proving the edge wasn’t speed but adaptive logic.

3. **Strategy 3**: Structural Spread Lock  
Overview: Trade short-duration Polymarket markets by exploiting order-book imbalances—buying both sides during panic mispricing and holding to settlement to capture the guaranteed spread minus fees, independent of market direction

4. **Strategy 4**: Systematic NO Farming  
Overview: Consistently bet NO on overhyped outcomes, exploiting the fact that most prediction markets statistically resolve to NO while the crowd overpays for unlikely “miracle” outcomes.

5. **Strategy 5**:  Long-Shot Floor Buying  
Overview: Buy YES shares at the absolute minimum price (≈0.1¢) across thousands of markets, capping downside per bet while relying on rare but inevitable long-shot resolutions to generate asymmetric upside.

6. **Strategy 6**: Spread Farming  
Overview: Use a high-frequency bot on Polymarket’s CLOB to repeatedly buy at the bid and sell at the ask, capturing tiny spreads thousands of times per day—sometimes hedged across platforms to neutralize price risk.


7. **Strategy 7**: High-Probability Auto-Compounding  
Overview: A fully automated bot repeatedly trades short-duration crypto up/down markets by buying high-probability contracts (≈$0.90–$0.99), capturing small spreads and incentives thousands of times a day to compound returns purely through execution and scale.
